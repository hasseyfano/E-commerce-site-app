eCommerce Site with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This project is a comprehensive eCommerce website built using modern web technologies. It provides users with a seamless shopping experience, allowing them to browse a wide range of products, add items to their cart, and securely complete their purchases. The website is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a responsive layout that ensures compatibility across various devices.
Features

The eCommerce site boasts several key features that enhance both the user and administrator experience:

User Authentication: Utilizing Node.js and Express, the site offers robust user authentication functionality. Users can easily sign up for an account, securely sign in, and manage their profiles. This ensures a personalized experience for each user and enables features such as order tracking and account preferences.

Product Management: Administrators have the capability to manage the product catalog efficiently. Using MongoDB for data storage, administrators can add new products, update existing ones, and remove items that are no longer available. This ensures that the product catalog is always up-to-date and reflective of current inventory.

Shopping Cart: The site includes a fully functional shopping cart feature, allowing users to add products to their cart and proceed to checkout seamlessly. The shopping cart utilizes JavaScript to dynamically update quantities and totals, providing users with real-time feedback as they shop.

Order Management: Both users and administrators have access to comprehensive order management tools. Users can view their order history, track the status of their shipments, and manage returns or exchanges. Administrators have additional capabilities, such as processing orders, updating order statuses, and generating reports.

Payment Integration: To facilitate secure transactions, the site integrates with a payment gateway. This ensures that sensitive payment information is encrypted and protected during the checkout process, giving users peace of mind when making purchases online.
Technology Stack

The eCommerce site leverages a modern technology stack to deliver a robust and scalable solution:

    JavaScript: The primary programming language used for both client-side and server-side development, ensuring a cohesive and consistent development experience.

    Node.js: Utilized as the server-side runtime environment, providing an event-driven architecture that enables efficient handling of concurrent requests.

    Express: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js, used to streamline the development of web applications and APIs, offering features such as routing, middleware, and templating.

    MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database used for storing product data, user information, and order details. Its schema-less nature allows for agile development and easy adaptation to changing requirements.

    Git: Version control system utilized for collaborative development, enabling multiple developers to work on the project simultaneously and track changes over time.
